    Soft drinks are sweet, fizzy beverages that people enjoy all around the world. They come in many flavors such as 
cola, lemon-lime, orange, and fruit punch, and are often served cold with meals or as a refreshing treat on hot 
days. Some have caffeine for an energy boost, while others are caffeine-free. While soft drinks are fun and tasty, 
they are usually high in sugar, so drinking them too often can be unhealthy. To give people more choices, many 
brands now offer diet or sugar-free versions.Different types of soft drinks are popular in different countries. 
In the United States, Coca-Cola and Pepsi are the most famous, while Peru is known for Inca Kola, Scotland for 
Irn-Bru, and India for Thums Up. No matter the brand or flavor, soft drinks are loved for their sweetness, fizz, 
and refreshing taste.
