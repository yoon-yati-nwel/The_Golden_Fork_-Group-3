    Fried chicken is a popular dish made by coating pieces of chicken in flour or batter and then cooking them 
in hot oil until they’re crispy and golden. People enjoy it in many ways—some like it spicy, some prefer it mild, 
and others love it extra crunchy. It can be made with drumsticks, wings, thighs, or even boneless pieces. Fried 
chicken is often served with sides like coleslaw, mashed potatoes, biscuits, or corn on the cob. Some people dip 
it in sauces like honey mustard, barbecue, or hot sauce to add even more flavor. While it’s a comfort food favorite, 
fried chicken also provides protein and iron, though it can be high in fat depending on how it’s cooked. Different 
styles of fried chicken exist around the world. Southern-style fried chicken is famous in the United States, while 
Korean fried chicken is known for its double-fried crispiness and sweet-spicy glaze. No matter the style, fried 
chicken is loved for its satisfying crunch and juicy taste.
